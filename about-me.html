    <div class="about-me">
        <p>Back in 2018, I decided that I would study computers to understand 
            the complexity behind the technologies. <br> I'm currently studying Computer Engineering at 
            CITE or also known as Center for Industrial Technology and Enterprise. 
            The programming language they're implementing is C and Java also Web.</p>
        <p>Since I was a child I'm really into technologies and always wondering how did these things work.
            In Grade 11, the first programming language that I've learned is C++, and C 
            It was very challenging for me since I have a low comprehension and 
            I study hard just to understand each variables and the functionality 
            it also need common sense to understand how it works.
        </p>
        <p>My hobbies are wacthing animes, reading webtoon/manhwa/manhua.
            I also like to cook and to sing. My favorite color is blue 
            but i really have a lot of favorite colors. I also like to exercise.
